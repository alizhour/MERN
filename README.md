Hello,

To run this MERN project you need to:

  1.Download the project and extract the zip folder (should take like 10 mins to finish).

2. open the terminal and be sure you are in the correct directory, then type the command line: npm run dev. After this command the backend will start with the databse(MongoDB) then the frontend and you will be transferred directly to the project, if not open any browser and go to: LocalHost:3000.

3. When the project starts there are a form with validation to add users, and on the other side a table contain all users and their informations and options for edit or delete the user.

Hope that was helpful.
