Hello,

To run this MERN project you need to:

  1.Download the project and extract the zip folder (should take like 10 mins to finish).

2. open two terminals and be sure you are in the correct directory, then type in the first Terminal the 2 commands lines: 
<strong>cd client</strong>,
then <strong>npm start</strong>. 
After this commands the frontend will start and you will be transferred directly to the project, if not open any browser and go to: LocalHost:3000.

3. In the other terminal be sure you are in the main directory and type:
<strong>nodemon serve.</strong>
After this coomand the backend and the databse(MONGODB) will starts.

4. When the project starts there are a form with validation to add users, and on the other side a table contain all users and their informations and options for edit or delete the user.

Hope that was helpful.
